## Hi there, everyone! I'm Aaron Underhill, and I'm, like, a baddie.

- What I'm currently learning: One of the classes I'm learning is called "Software Engineering II", which essentially focuses on how coding creation is done in the real-world in group settings. 

-  💬 Ask me about: Running, I LOVEEEEE to run. But also walkability cities, that is another huge interest of mine.💬
   
- 📫 How to reach me: Through my email! underhaa@oregonstate.edu
  
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him, though I don't mind if anyone refers to me as they/them.
  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have an identical twin brother (though he's no where as good-looking as I am).
